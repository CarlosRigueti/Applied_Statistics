    "> **Simulation Using NumPy to Verify the Theoretical Probability**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> To verify the theoretical probability of correctly identifying all tea-first cups by chance, we will simulate the **Lady Tasting Tea** experiment using **NumPy**. The simulation process will randomly shuffle the cups and estimate the probability based on numerous trials. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the simulation works:\n",
    ">\n",
    "> ---\n",
    ">\n",
    "> 1. **Setting Up the Cups**:  \n",
    ">    We represent the cups as an array where:\n",
    ">    - `1` represents a **tea-first** cup, and\n",
    ">    - `0` represents a **milk-first** cup.\n",
    ">    \n",
    ">    In the original experiment, we have 4 tea-first cups and 4 milk-first cups, so our array will look like this:\n",
    ">    ```python\n",
    ">    cups_8 = np.array([1]*4 + [0]*4)\n",
    ">    ```\n",
    ">    This creates an array with 4 tea-first cups (`1`s) and 4 milk-first cups (`0`s).\n",
    ">\n",
    "> 2. **Simulation Setup**:  \n",
    ">    We run the simulation for a large number of trials (in this case, 150,000) to ensure the results are statistically significant and reliable.  \n",
    ">    The variable `trials` is set to 150,000, and we initialize the `successes` counter to 0, which will keep track of how many times the participant guesses the cups correctly.\n",
    ">    \n",
    ">    ```python\n",
    ">    trials = 150000\n",
    ">    successes = 0\n",
    ">    ```\n",
    ">\n",
    "> 3. **Simulation Loop**:  \n",
    ">    For each trial, the following steps occur:\n",
    ">    - **Shuffle the Cups**:  \n",
    ">      We randomly shuffle the cups array to simulate a random order of cups. This step represents the random arrangement of cups the participant is presented with.\n",
    ">      ```python\n",
    ">      np.random.shuffle(cups_8)\n",
    ">      ```\n",
    ">    - **Randomly Select 4 Cups**:  \n",
    ">      The participant then randomly selects 4 cups from the 8 available cups. The `np.random.choice()` function is used to randomly select indices from the array.\n",
    ">      ```python\n",
    ">      guessed_cups = cups_8[np.random.choice(range(8), size=4, replace=False)]\n",
    ">      ```\n",
    ">    - **Check If All Selected Cups Are Tea-First**:  \n",
    ">      After selecting the 4 cups, we check if all selected cups are tea-first (i.e., if the sum of the selected cups equals 4). The sum of the array will be equal to 4 if all 4 selected cups are tea-first (`1`s).\n",
    ">      ```python\n",
    ">      if np.sum(guessed_cups) == 4:\n",
    ">          successes += 1\n",
    ">      ```\n",
    ">\n",
    "> 4. **Estimating the Probability**:  \n",
    ">    After running all 150,000 simulations, we estimate the probability of guessing all tea-first cups correctly by dividing the number of successes by the total number of trials.\n",
    ">    ```python\n",
    ">    simulated_probability = successes / trials\n",
    ">    print(\"Estimated probability from simulation:\", simulated_probability)\n",
    ">    ```\n",
    ">    The result will provide an empirical estimate of the probability of correctly identifying all tea-first cups by random chance.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> ---\n",
    ">\n",
    "> ### **Conclusion**\n",
    "> This simulation allows us to estimate the probability based on random guessing, and compare it with the theoretical probability calculated earlier. If the probability from the simulation is close to the theoretical value, it indicates that the simulation is a valid representation of the theoretical model. The larger the number of trials, the more accurate the simulation results will be.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> By running this simulation, we gain insight into the likelihood of randomly identifying all tea-first cups in the experiment, further confirming the low probability of such an outcome occurring by chance.\n",

    "### Conclusion:\n",
    "\n",
    "From the histogram and the statistical comparison, we observe the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Sample SD (ddof=1) tends to be slightly larger than the Population SD (ddof=0), particularly when the sample size is small. This is because the sample standard deviation is an unbiased estimator, whereas the population standard deviation tends to underestimate the true variability.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. As the sample size increases, the difference between the sample SD and the population SD shrinks, and both estimators become nearly identical for large samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The histograms show a clear visual difference in the two distributions, with the sample SD distribution being slightly shifted to the right (larger values).\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis demonstrates the impact of sample size on the estimation of variability and helps us understand the behavior of different standard deviation estimators.\n",

    "### Problem 3: t-Tests and Type II Errors\n",
    "\n",
    "In this problem, we are tasked with investigating Type II errors in hypothesis testing. A Type II error occurs when a statistical test fails to reject the null hypothesis even though it is actually false. In other words, it’s a “miss” — the test didn’t detect a real difference or effect when one actually exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will simulate the independent samples t-test and examine how the Type II error rate changes as the difference in means between two samples increases."

    "### Problem Breakdown\n",
    "\n",
    "- We are asked to simulate the t-test for different mean differences d (ranging from 0 to 1 in steps of 0.1).\n",
    "\n",
    "- For each value of d, we will:\n",
    "    1. Draw two samples of size 100:\n",
    "\n",
    "      - One sample is from the standard normal distribution (mean = 0, standard deviation = 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "      - The other sample is from the normal distribution with mean d and standard deviation 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "    2. Run an independent samples t-test to compare the two samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "    3. Reject the null hypothesis if the p-value is less than 0.05.\n",
    "\n",
    "    4. Record the proportion of times the null hypothesis is not rejected (which indicates a Type II error).\n",
    "\n",
    "    5. Plot the proportion of Type II errors against d, and explain how the Type II error rate changes as the difference in means increases\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Simulate the Data: For each mean difference d, we generate two sets of samples, each with 100 data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Conduct t-Tests: Perform an independent samples t-test to compare the two samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Calculate Proportion of Type II Errors: For each mean difference, calculate the proportion of times the null hypothesis is not rejected (i.e., the Type II error rate).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Plot the Results: Plot the proportion of Type II errors against d, and analyze the trend.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Libraries Needed:\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the following Python libraries:\n",
    "\n",
    " - NumPy: For generating random samples and numerical operations.\n",
    "\n",
    " - SciPy: For conducting the t-test.\n",
    "\n",
    " - Matplotlib: For plotting the results.\n",

    "#### Code Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Setting Parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    " - num_simulations = 1000: We repeat the simulation 1,000 times for each value of d.\n",
    "\n",
    " - sample_size = 100: Each sample consists of 100 data points.\n",
    "\n",
    " - alpha = 0.05: The significance level (p-value threshold) for the t-test is 0.05, which is commonly used in hypothesis testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Simulating the Data:\n",
    "\n",
    " - For each mean difference d in the range from 0 to 1 (in steps of 0.1), we generate two samples:\n",
    "\n",
    " - The first sample is drawn from the standard normal distribution with mean = 0 and standard deviation = 1.\n",
    "\n",
    " - The second sample is drawn from the normal distribution with mean = d and standard deviation = 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Conducting the t-Test:\n",
    "\n",
    " - We use stats.ttest_ind() from SciPy to perform an independent samples t-test on the two samples. This tests whether the means of the two samples are significantly different.\n",
    "\n",
    " - If the p-value from the t-test is greater than 0.05, we fail to reject the null hypothesis, which is considered a Type II error\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Tracking Type II Errors:\n",
    "\n",
    " - For each simulation, if we fail to reject the null hypothesis, we increment the error count.\n",
    "\n",
    " - After running 1,000 simulations for a given d, we compute the proportion of Type II errors (i.e., the ratio of times the null hypothesis was not rejected).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Plotting the Results:\n",
    "\n",
    " - Finally, we plot the proportion of Type II errors against the mean difference d. This shows how the error rate changes as the true mean difference between the two samples increases.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Expected Results and Interpretation:\n",
    "\n",
    " - When d=0 (i.e., there is no true difference between the two samples), the proportion of Type II errors will be high because the null hypothesis (that there is no difference) is true, but the t-test might still fail to reject it due to random variability.\n",
    "\n",
    " - As d increases, the true difference between the two samples becomes larger, making it easier to detect the difference. Therefore, the proportion of Type II errors should decrease as d increases, meaning that the test is more likely to reject the null hypothesis when there is a larger true difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Conclusion:\n",
    "\n",
    " - This simulation shows how the Type II error rate changes as the true difference between the means increases. When the difference is small, the error rate is high because it’s harder for the t-test to detect a difference. As the difference grows, the error rate decreases, and the test becomes more sensitive to differences.\n",
    "\n",
    " - Understanding Type II errors is crucial for determining the power of a statistical test. A low Type II error rate indicates that the test is sensitive and capable of detecting real differences when they exist."
