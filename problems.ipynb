    "In this task, we extend the classic Lady Tasting Tea experiment by increasing the number of cups  from 8 (4 tea-first, 4 milk-first) to 12 (8 tea-first, 4 milk-first). We will estimate the probability of correctly identifying all cups by chance using NumPy simulations and compare the results with the original 8-cup experiment to assess extreme outcomes and discuss possible adjustments to the p-value threshold.\n"
