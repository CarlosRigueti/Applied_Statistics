    "> **Simulation Using NumPy to Verify the Theoretical Probability**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> To verify the theoretical probability of correctly identifying all tea-first cups by chance, we will simulate the **Lady Tasting Tea** experiment using **NumPy**. The simulation process will randomly shuffle the cups and estimate the probability based on numerous trials. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the simulation works:\n",
    ">\n",
    "> ---\n",
    ">\n",
    "> 1. **Setting Up the Cups**:  \n",
    ">    We represent the cups as an array where:\n",
    ">    - `1` represents a **tea-first** cup, and\n",
    ">    - `0` represents a **milk-first** cup.\n",
    ">    \n",
    ">    In the original experiment, we have 4 tea-first cups and 4 milk-first cups, so our array will look like this:\n",
    ">    ```python\n",
    ">    cups_8 = np.array([1]*4 + [0]*4)\n",
    ">    ```\n",
    ">    This creates an array with 4 tea-first cups (`1`s) and 4 milk-first cups (`0`s).\n",
    ">\n",
    "> 2. **Simulation Setup**:  \n",
    ">    We run the simulation for a large number of trials (in this case, 150,000) to ensure the results are statistically significant and reliable.  \n",
    ">    The variable `trials` is set to 150,000, and we initialize the `successes` counter to 0, which will keep track of how many times the participant guesses the cups correctly.\n",
    ">    \n",
    ">    ```python\n",
    ">    trials = 150000\n",
    ">    successes = 0\n",
    ">    ```\n",
    ">\n",
    "> 3. **Simulation Loop**:  \n",
    ">    For each trial, the following steps occur:\n",
    ">    - **Shuffle the Cups**:  \n",
    ">      We randomly shuffle the cups array to simulate a random order of cups. This step represents the random arrangement of cups the participant is presented with.\n",
    ">      ```python\n",
    ">      np.random.shuffle(cups_8)\n",
    ">      ```\n",
    ">    - **Randomly Select 4 Cups**:  \n",
    ">      The participant then randomly selects 4 cups from the 8 available cups. The `np.random.choice()` function is used to randomly select indices from the array.\n",
    ">      ```python\n",
    ">      guessed_cups = cups_8[np.random.choice(range(8), size=4, replace=False)]\n",
    ">      ```\n",
    ">    - **Check If All Selected Cups Are Tea-First**:  \n",
    ">      After selecting the 4 cups, we check if all selected cups are tea-first (i.e., if the sum of the selected cups equals 4). The sum of the array will be equal to 4 if all 4 selected cups are tea-first (`1`s).\n",
    ">      ```python\n",
    ">      if np.sum(guessed_cups) == 4:\n",
    ">          successes += 1\n",
    ">      ```\n",
    ">\n",
    "> 4. **Estimating the Probability**:  \n",
    ">    After running all 150,000 simulations, we estimate the probability of guessing all tea-first cups correctly by dividing the number of successes by the total number of trials.\n",
    ">    ```python\n",
    ">    simulated_probability = successes / trials\n",
    ">    print(\"Estimated probability from simulation:\", simulated_probability)\n",
    ">    ```\n",

    ">\n",
    "> ---\n",
    ">\n",
    "> ### **Conclusion**\n",
    "> This simulation allows us to estimate the probability based on random guessing, and compare it with the theoretical probability calculated earlier. If the probability from the simulation is close to the theoretical value, it indicates that the simulation is a valid representation of the theoretical model. The larger the number of trials, the more accurate the simulation results will be.\n",
    ">\n",

    "\n",
    "From the histogram and the statistical comparison, we observe the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Sample SD **(ddof=1)** tends to be slightly larger than the Population SD **(ddof=0)**, particularly when the sample size is small. This is because the sample standard deviation is an unbiased estimator, whereas the population standard deviation tends to underestimate the true variability.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. As the sample size increases, the difference between the sample SD and the population SD shrinks, and both estimators become nearly identical for large samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The histograms show a clear visual difference in the two distributions, with the sample SD distribution being slightly shifted to the right **(larger values)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis demonstrates the impact of sample size on the estimation of variability and helps us understand the behavior of different standard deviation estimators.\n",

The standard deviation of the sample will also converge to the population standard deviation as sample sizes grow larger.

    "    4. Record the proportion of times the null hypothesis is not rejected (which indicates a Type II error).\n",
    "\n",
    "    5. Plot the proportion of Type II errors against d, and explain how the Type II error rate changes as the difference in means increases\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Steps**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Simulate the Data: For each mean difference d, we generate two sets of samples, each with 100 data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Conduct t-Tests: Perform an independent samples t-test to compare the two samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Calculate Proportion of Type II Errors: For each mean difference, calculate the proportion of times the null hypothesis is not rejected (i.e., the Type II error rate).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Plot the Results: Plot the proportion of Type II errors against d, and analyze the trend.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Libraries Needed**:\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the following Python libraries:\n",
    "\n",
    " - NumPy: For generating random samples and numerical operations.\n",
    "\n",
    " - SciPy: For conducting the t-test.\n",
    "\n",
    " - Matplotlib: For plotting the results.\n",

    "#### **Code Explanation**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Setting Parameters**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - _num_simulations = 1000_: We repeat the simulation 1,000 times for each value of d.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - _sample_size_ = 100: Each sample consists of 100 data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - _alpha = 0.05_: The significance level (p-value threshold) for the t-test is _0.05_, which is commonly used in hypothesis testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Simulating the Data**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - For each mean difference d in the range from 0 to 1 _(in steps of 0.1)_, we generate two samples:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - The first sample is drawn from the standard normal distribution with _mean = 0_ and standard deviation _= 1_.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - The second sample is drawn from the normal distribution with _mean = d_ and standard deviation _= 1_.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Conducting the t-Test**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - We use stats.ttest_ind() from SciPy to perform an independent samples _t-test_ on the two samples. This tests whether the means of the two samples are significantly different.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - If the p-value from the t-test is greater than _0.05_, we fail to reject the null hypothesis, which is considered a _Type II_ error\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Tracking Type II Errors**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - For each simulation, if we fail to reject the null hypothesis, we increment the error count.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - After running 1,000 simulations for a given d, we compute the proportion of _Type II_ errors _(i.e., the ratio of times the null hypothesis was not rejected)_.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Plotting the Results**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Finally, we plot the proportion of _Type II_ errors against the mean difference _d._ This shows how the error rate changes as the true mean difference between the two samples increases.\n",
    "\n",
    " ---\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Expected Results and Interpretation**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **When d=0** _(i.e., there is no true difference between the two samples)_, the proportion of Type II errors will be high because the null hypothesis (that there is no difference) is true, but the t-test might still fail to reject it due to random variability.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - As _d_ increases, the true difference between the two samples becomes larger, making it easier to detect the difference. Therefore, the proportion of Type II errors should decrease as d increases, meaning that the test is more likely to reject the null hypothesis when there is a larger true difference.\n",
    "\n",
    " ---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Conclusion**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - This simulation shows how the Type II error rate changes as the true difference between the means increases. When the difference is small, the error rate is high because it’s harder for the t-test to detect a difference. As the difference grows, the error rate decreases, and the test becomes more sensitive to differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Understanding Type II errors is crucial for determining the power of a statistical test. A low Type II error rate indicates that the test is sensitive and capable of detecting real differences when they exist.\n",

    "### Effect of Sample Size on Type II Errors:\n",
    "Increasing the sample size has a direct effect on reducing the **Type II error rate**. With a larger sample size, the test becomes more sensitive and more likely to reject the null hypothesis when it is false. In the context of the t-test, this means that as the difference between means increases, the test is better at detecting the difference, resulting in fewer Type II errors.\n",

    "### Problem 4: ANOVA (Analysis of Variance):\n",
    "\n",
    "In this problem, we are tasked with performing a one-way ANOVA to test whether the means of three independent samples drawn from normal distributions are equal. Additionally, we will perform three independent two-sample t-tests to compare the means of the pairs of samples and compare the conclusions. Finally, we will discuss why ANOVA is preferred over conducting multiple t-tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Understanding the Problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "**ANOVA** (Analysis of Variance) is a statistical method used to compare the means of more than two groups. In this case, we will compare the means of three samples. The null hypothesis (H₀) in **ANOVA** is that all the group means are equal, and the alternative hypothesis (H₁) is that at least one group mean is different.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, t-tests are typically used to compare the means of two groups at a time. We are asked to perform three t-tests:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Sample 1 vs. Sample 2\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Sample 1 vs. Sample 3\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Sample 2 vs. Sample 3\n",
    "\n",
    "After performing these t-tests, we will compare the results with the **ANOVA** conclusion and discuss the advantages of using **ANOVA**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Steps to Solve the Problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Generate the Data: We will generate three independent samples from normal distributions with means of 0, 0.5, and 1, and a standard deviation of 1. Each sample will contain 30 values.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Perform One-Way **ANOVA**: We will use the **ANOVA** test to compare the means of the three samples and check if they are significantly different.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Perform Two-Sample t-Tests: We will conduct three independent two-sample t-tests to compare the means of the sample pairs.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Compare the Results: We will compare the conclusions from the **ANOVA** and the t-tests and explain why **ANOVA** is generally preferred over multiple t-tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step-by-Step Solution:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Generate the Data\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's generate the three independent samples. Each sample will be of size 30, drawn from normal distributions with means 0, 0.5, and 1, and standard deviation 1."

    "\n",
    "**- ANOVA** vs. t-tests: While t-tests can be used to compare the means of two samples, when you have three or more samples, performing multiple t-tests increases the risk of Type I errors (false positives). This happens because each t-test has its own 5% chance of incorrectly rejecting the null hypothesis, and when performed multiple times, the overall probability of incorrectly rejecting the null hypothesis increases.\n",
    "\n",
    "**- ANOVA** is designed to test all the groups at once, reducing the overall Type I error rate. By using a single statistical test, ANOVA controls the error rate more effectively and provides a clearer picture of whether there is any significant difference among the groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, ***ANOVA** is preferred when comparing the means of three or more groups because it allows for a more robust and reliable test without inflating the error rate, as multiple t-tests would.\n",

Multiple t-tests increase the risk of **false positives** (rejecting a true null hypothesis), and this is known as the **family-wise error rate**. By using ANOVA, you control the overall error rate, avoiding the inflation of false positives that comes with multiple comparisons."

    "### Family-Wise Error Rate and Why ANOVA is Preferred:\n",
    "When performing multiple t-tests, the **family-wise error rate (FWER)** increases, meaning the probability of committing at least one Type I error (false positive) across multiple tests becomes larger. This is because each t-test carries a 5% chance of falsely rejecting the null hypothesis, and when performed multiple times, the overall error rate grows. **ANOVA** controls for this by testing all groups at once, reducing the risk of Type I errors. This makes ANOVA a more reliable method for comparing three or more groups.\n"
