# Statistical Simulation and Hypothesis Testing  
**Final Project – Data Analytics**

## Overview

This project presents a set of simulation-based statistical analyses focusing on probability,
sampling distributions, and hypothesis testing. Using Monte Carlo simulations, the project
explores classical inferential statistics concepts and compares theoretical expectations with
empirical results obtained through repeated random sampling.

The work emphasizes both **computational implementation** and **statistical interpretation**,
highlighting how simulation can be used to better understand uncertainty, variability,
and decision-making in statistical inference.

## Project Motivation

Many results in statistics are derived theoretically under ideal assumptions.
This project aims to complement theory with simulation, allowing key statistical properties
to be observed empirically. By repeatedly simulating experiments and hypothesis tests,
the project demonstrates how probabilities, error rates, and test performance behave in practice.

---

## Methodology

All analyses are conducted using Monte Carlo simulation techniques.

- Random samples are generated from specified probability distributions.
- Each experiment is repeated a large number of times to approximate theoretical quantities.
- Statistical tests are performed under standard assumptions such as independence and normality.
- Results are summarized using numerical estimates and visualizations.
- Findings are interpreted in the context of statistical theory.

## Tools and Libraries

- Python  
- NumPy  
- SciPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Jupyter Notebook  

---

## Reproducibility

- A fixed random seed is used where appropriate to ensure reproducibility.
- All simulations, figures, and results can be regenerated by running the notebook from top to bottom.
- No external datasets are required.

## Assessment Problems

Follow the [assessment instructions](assessment.md) and the guidance provided in
[guidance.ipynb] to ensure the problems are addressed correctly.

### Problem 1: Extending the Lady Tasting Tea

The original Lady Tasting Tea experiment consists of 8 cups:  
4 tea-first and 4 milk-first.

In this extension, 12 cups are prepared:  
8 tea-first and 4 milk-first.

A participant claims they can identify which liquid was poured first.

The task is to simulate this experiment using `numpy` by randomly shuffling the cups many times
and estimating the probability that the participant correctly identifies all cups by chance.
The estimated probability is then compared with the probability from the original 8-cup design.

The notebook includes:
- A clear explanation of the simulation procedure
- The estimated probability and its interpretation
- A discussion on whether the p-value threshold should be extended or relaxed compared
  to the original experiment

### Problem 2: Normal Distribution

A total of 100,000 samples of size 10 are generated from the standard normal distribution.

For each sample:
- The standard deviation is computed using `ddof=1` (sample standard deviation)
- The standard deviation is computed using `ddof=0` (population standard deviation)

Histograms of both sets of values are plotted on the same axes with transparency.

The analysis includes:
- A description of the observed differences between the two distributions
- An explanation of how these differences are expected to change as sample size increases

---

### Problem 3: t-Tests and Type II Error

A type II error occurs when the null hypothesis is not rejected even though it is false.

For each mean difference  
\( d = 0, 0.1, 0.2, \dots, 1.0 \),  
the following simulation is repeated 1,000 times:

1. Two samples of size 100 are drawn:
   - One from a standard normal distribution
   - One from a normal distribution with mean \( d \) and standard deviation 1
2. An independent samples t-test is performed
3. The null hypothesis is rejected if the p-value is less than 0.05
4. The proportion of times the null hypothesis is not rejected is recorded

The results are visualized by plotting the type II error rate against the mean difference \( d \),
followed by an interpretation of how statistical power changes as the effect size increases.

---

### Problem 4: ANOVA

Three independent samples of size 30 are generated from normal distributions with:
- Means: 0, 0.5, and 1
- Standard deviation: 1

The analysis consists of:
1. A one-way ANOVA to test whether all group means are equal
2. Three independent two-sample t-tests:
   - Sample 1 vs Sample 2
   - Sample 1 vs Sample 3
   - Sample 2 vs Sample 3
3. A comparison of conclusions obtained from ANOVA and multiple t-tests

A short discussion explains why ANOVA is preferred over performing several pairwise t-tests.

---

## Interpretation and Discussion

Each problem includes a written interpretation connecting simulation outcomes
to statistical theory. Emphasis is placed on understanding p-values, estimator behavior,
error rates, and the consequences of multiple testing.

---

## Limitations

- Simulations assume normally distributed data.
- Results depend on the chosen sample sizes and number of repetitions.
- Real-world data may violate model assumptions, which can affect inference.
