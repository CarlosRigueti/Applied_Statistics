# Higher Diploma in Science - Data Analytics  
## Applied Statistics - Assessment  

This repository contains the assessment project for the **Applied Statistics** module in the **Higher Diploma in Data Analytics** program. The contents of this README are designed following [GitHub's documentation for READMEs](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-readmes) to ensure clarity and consistency. This project showcases the application of statistical concepts through data analysis and visualization using tools like Python and Jupyter Notebook.

## Purpose of This Assessment

The goal of this assessment is to test your understanding of applied statistics by engaging in hands-on analysis and simulations. Key areas of focus include probability theory, hypothesis testing, understanding sampling distributions, and the application of statistical methods like t-tests and ANOVA.  

This project provides you with the opportunity to demonstrate the skills you have developed throughout the course, particularly in the areas of **data analysis**, **programming**, and **data visualization**.  

## How to Use This Assessment

This repository serves as a demonstration of the core skills developed during the course. You will be working with data analysis, programming, and data visualization, all implemented using **Jupyter Notebook** and **Python**.  

## Assessment Breakdown

### Problem 1: Extending the Lady Tasting Tea  
This problem extends the classic **Lady Tasting Tea** experiment.  
- **Task:** Simulate various outcomes to estimate probabilities and interpret these results using hypothesis testing.  
- **Objective:** Understand how experimental design affects the likelihood of extreme outcomes occurring by chance.

### Problem 2: Normal Distribution  
Generate large sample sets from a **standard normal distribution**.  
- **Task:** Compare sample and population standard deviations.  
- **Objective:** Investigate the effect of sample size on the variability of data and the estimation of standard deviation.

### Problem 3: t-Tests  
Simulate independent sample sets with varying mean differences.  
- **Task:** Conduct **t-tests** to test for statistical significance.  
- **Objective:** Explore how the rate of Type II errors changes as the true difference between populations increases.

### Problem 4: ANOVA  
Generate multiple independent sample sets with varying means.  
- **Task:** Perform a **one-way ANOVA** and pairwise **t-tests**.  
- **Objective:** Understand why **ANOVA** is preferred when comparing more than two groups, especially in controlling error rates.
