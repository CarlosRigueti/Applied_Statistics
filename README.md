## Overview

This repository contains the assessment project for the **Applied Statistics** module of the  
**Higher Diploma in Science in Data Analytics** program.

The README is structured in accordance with
[GitHub’s official documentation for READMEs](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-readmes),
ensuring clarity, consistency, and ease of navigation.

The project demonstrates the practical application of statistical concepts through
**simulation, data analysis, and visualization**, using **Python** and **Jupyter Notebook**.

## Purpose of the Assessment

The objective of this assessment is to evaluate understanding of **applied statistical methods**
through hands-on analysis and simulation.

Key areas of focus include:
- Probability theory  
- Sampling distributions  
- Hypothesis testing  
- Type I and Type II errors  
- t-tests and analysis of variance (ANOVA)

This project provides an opportunity to demonstrate skills developed throughout the course,
particularly in:
- **Data analysis**
- **Statistical reasoning**
- **Programming with Python**
- **Data visualization**

## How to Use This Repository

This repository serves as both an academic submission and a demonstration of applied data analytics skills.

All analyses are implemented using **Python** within **Jupyter Notebooks**.
To explore the project:
1. Clone or download the repository
2. Open the notebooks using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
3. Run the notebooks from top to bottom to reproduce the results

## Assessment Breakdown

### Problem 1: Extending the Lady Tasting Tea

This problem extends the classic **Lady Tasting Tea** experiment.

- **Task:**  
  Simulate multiple experimental outcomes to estimate probabilities and interpret the results
  using hypothesis testing.

- **Objective:**  
  Understand how changes in experimental design affect the likelihood of extreme outcomes
  occurring by chance.

---

### Problem 2: Normal Distribution

Large samples are generated from a **standard normal distribution**.

- **Task:**  
  Compare sample standard deviation (`ddof=1`) and population standard deviation (`ddof=0`).

- **Objective:**  
  Investigate how sample size influences variability and the estimation of standard deviation.

---

### Problem 3: t-Tests

Independent samples are simulated with varying mean differences.

- **Task:**  
  Conduct independent **t-tests** to assess statistical significance.

- **Objective:**  
  Explore how the **Type II error rate** changes as the true difference between populations increases.

---

### Problem 4: ANOVA

Multiple independent samples are generated with different means.

- **Task:**  
  Perform a **one-way ANOVA** and compare results with multiple pairwise **t-tests**.

- **Objective:**  
  Understand why **ANOVA** is preferred when comparing more than two groups,
  particularly in controlling error rates.
